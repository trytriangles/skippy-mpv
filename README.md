# skippy-mpv ü¶ò

An [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) script to skip the unwanted portions of your media.

## Description

During audio or video playback, skippy-mpv looks for an .edl (edit decision list) file with the same name and location of your media file. If that EDL file exists, consists of (start timestamp, end timestamp, flag int) lines like

```
01:20:33.213 01:23:14.000 0
```

and the flag is 0, then the period between the two timestamps is skipped.

This partially replicates behavior seen in [Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc).

## Installation

Place `skippy.lua` in your mpv installation's `scripts` folder, or launch mpv with `--scripts skippy.lua`.

## To do

- Implement creation of EDL files.
- Implement millisecond precision.
- Display the skips as Matroska chapters, if possible.
- Modify the reported runtime in mpv, if possible.
- Implement the commercial-skipping behavior from Kodi, i.e., skip upon natural encounter but allow rewinding.
- Optimization: rather than observe the time-pos property for the entire duration, register a timer that checks the time-pos and skips, and re-evaluate those timers upon file-load and seek events.
